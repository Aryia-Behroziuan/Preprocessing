# Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is an important step in the data mining process. The phrase "garbage in, garbage out" is particularly applicable to data mining and machine learning projects. Data-gathering methods are often loosely controlled, resulting in out-of-range values (e.g., Income: âˆ’100), impossible data combinations (e.g., Sex: Male, Pregnant: Yes), and missing values, etc. Analyzing data that has not been carefully screened for such problems can produce misleading results. Thus, the representation and quality of data is first and foremost before running any analysis.[1] Often, data preprocessing is the most important phase of a machine learning project, especially in computational biology.[2]
